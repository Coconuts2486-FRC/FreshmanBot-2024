The Shooter subsystem is a velocity-controlled mechanism designed to shoot
a gamepiece into a goal.  This specific module contains a modified version of
the AdvantageKit "Flywheel" subsystem, with the hardware-specific module being
modified from TalonFX (Phoenix6 library) to the TalonSRX (Phoenix5 library).

If this shooter module is to be used on other robots with different hardware,
the TalonFX or SparkMax modules from the AdvantakeKit "Flywheel" should be
copied here and appropriately modified.

NOTE: The code in this module is written for velocity-controlled mechanisms,
and should not be used directly for position-controlled mechanisms (elevators,
arms, etc.).
